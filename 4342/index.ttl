    rdfs:label "Isle of Herne in the gulf of Dakhla? Hanno indicates he navigated 2 days to the South from Larache, 1 day to the East, and that the island has a perimeter of Â½ nautical mile, and that it is inside a gulf, about 850 nautical miles from Ceuta. The isle of Herne is inside of the gulf of Dakhla (also called Rio de Oro) which is more than 20 nautical miles long and is located about 1000 nautical miles from Ceuta. The isle of Herne has a perimeter in the order of 1 nautical mile.
