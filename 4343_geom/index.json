An island with gorillas was located on a lake which was located on an island in this bay: the isle of Mbani\u00e9 is now a tiny island which might once have been part of Corisco island and its surrounding lagoon, itself located in Corisco bay (Gabon) around 200 nautical miles south of Mount Cameroon. This similarity is obviously hypothetical, but it is plausible ...\r\nNote that in this area trade winds and currents are North oriented, and therefore  quite adverse for navigating further South.
