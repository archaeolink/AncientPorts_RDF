    rdfs:label "Zula, on wadi Haddas. The Periplus Maris Erythraei locates Adulis at 3000 stadia (ca. 550 km) south of Ptolemais inside a south facing bay, which corresponds to Zula. Pliny locates it at 5 navigation days from Ptolemais, which leads to more or less the same location. It may be noted that Ptolemy is widely mistaken when locating it at 40â€™ of latitude north of Dire, leading near Assab, 200 km further south. The site of Zula is now widely accepted by modern authors.  Foundation"@en ;
