	abstract     = {Summary.  A wide range of geomaterials were worked at industrial settlements scattered over an area of c.225 km2 in the Poole Harbour–Isle of Purbeck district of modern Dorset. These materials, more than one handled at some sites, included shale (‘coal’), burnt shales (yellow, red) and cementstones from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (Upper Jurassic), Purbeck marble from the Purbeck Group (earliest Cretaceous), hard chalk from the Chalk Group (Upper Cretaceous), and potting clays and sands from the Bracklesham Group (Palaeogene), for South-east Dorset Black-burnished Pottery Category 1. There was also a salt industry, which could have used pottery for packaging. The industrial products are conterminously distributed in southern and central Britain and, in the case of pottery and shale items, reached as far as the northern frontiers. Raw material of red burnt shale was exported to Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum), where it was made into mosaic tesserae. Of proven Kimmeridgian age on the evidence of fossils, the mudstone used to make it had been collected and quarried on the coast of the Isle of Purbeck before being burnt. The decline in the demand for stone products, excepting shale, in the second century AD saw an expansion of the potting industry, which persisted into the fifth century. The term complex-agglomerative is introduced to describe this diverse and dispersed enterprise at this highest hierarchical level, examples of which occur elsewhere in the Roman world.}

Attention is paid to the evidence for the generally good relations between the Greeks and Phoenicians and the presence of each in the other's settlements. Their spheres of influence mirror closely that of Cypriots and Greeks in the west at the end of the Bronze Age, and some degree of low-level continuity is probable, until demands for land and materials prompted more decisive re-exploration. It was in the second quarter of the eighth century that moves involving serious settlement are most apparent: Euboeans east of Al Mina in Syria (for trade), Euboeans and Phoenicians west to Ischia and Carthage (for land, eventually trade). The phenomena are near-contemporary.}

	abstract     = {Ancient Alexandria possessed not only an important maritime front but also a long lake waterfront on its southern side. This dual waterfront was praised by the ancient geographer Strabo in the first century BCE, because its geomorphological configuration opened Alexandria to Mediterranean trade, and also the Nile delta and Egypt. While the city's maritime palaeogeography has been widely described and studied, Alexandria's lacustrine waterfront has largely been neglected and little is known about its palaeo-geography and archaeology. Here we report the chronostratigraphy of the southern edge of the modern city. Bio-sedimentological analyses of sediment archives allow us to reconstruct the evolution of the depositional environments and palaeogeographies for parts of ancient Alexandria's lacustrine waterfront. The chronological framework spans the last 2000years. By marrying our data with ancient maps and historical sources, we propose a location for Portus Mareoticus. The lake's geomorphology suggests the presence of three ancient jetties, perpendicular to the shoreline and several hundreds meters long. The occupation of the investigated area began at the end of the first century BCE, linked to Roman domination and probably ended during late Roman times. The waterfront was then disconnected from the city during the 9thcenturyCE, due to the desiccation of Maryut Lake, concomitant with the drying-up of the Canopic branch. Alexandria canal subsequently became the sole waterway linking the city to the Nile. The most western part of the canal, which extended freshwater supply and fluvial navigation down to the western marine harbour of Alexandria, was completed in the 16th century, probably in relation to the development of the marine harbours at the beginning of the Ottoman period. Our research sheds new light on the topography of ancient Alexandria.}

	abstract     = {The Predynastic settlement of Maadi—after which the Chalcolithic Lower Egyptian Culture of the first half of the 4th millennium is named—is a key site for the understanding of the interconnections between Lower and Upper Egypt, as well as between the Nile valley and the Southern Levant. Although at first glance it was a rural village with agriculture as subsistence basis, the settlement—on the one hand—yielded Upper Egyptian imports which point to trade relations within the Nile valley and which enable to place the settlement into the frame of the Naqada culture chronology. On the other hand, there is evidence for different phases of connections to the southern Levant: Unusual semi-subterranean cave-like structures which—although much less sophisticated—resemble the subterranean installations of the Chalcolithic Beersheva Culture. Later still Maadi must have operated trade connections with several EB IA settlements in southern Palestine to acquire copper and other commodities. This chronologically diverging evidence is discussed here and complemented by a series of radiocarbon dates retrieved from renewed excavations at Maadi by the German Archaeological Institute, Cairo. The dates confirm that the chronological position of the settlement is contemporaneous with the transition from the Late Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age in the Southern Levant. L'établissement Prédynastique de Maadi, qui a donné son nom à la culture chalcolithique de Basse-Égypte de la première moitié du 4e millénaire, est un site clé pour la compréhension des interconnections entre la Haute et la Basse-Égypte, et entre la Vallée du Nil et le sud du Levant. Si l'établissement évoque à première vue un village rural fondé sur l'agriculture, le site a révélé des importations venant de Haute-Égypte, suggérant des relations commerciales dans la Vallée du Nil et permettant de situer cet établissement dans la chronologie de la culture de Naqada. En outre, le site a révélé l'existence de différentes phases de relations avec le sud du Levant: des structures inhabituelles, semi-souterraines, ressemblent aux installations souterraines de la culture chalcolithique de Beersheva, bien que moins sophistiquées que ces dernières. Plus tard, Maadi semble avoir établi des relations commerciales avec des sites du Bronze ancien IA dans le sud de la Palestine, afin d'obtenir du cuivre et d'autres marchandises. Ces données, divergentes chronologiquement, sont commentées et complétées par une série de datations radiocarbones issues des nouvelles fouilles menées à Maadi par l'Institut archéologique allemand au Caire (DAI). Ces dates confirment que l'établissement est contemporain de la transition entre le Chalcolithique récent et le Bronze ancien dans le sud du Levant.}

	abstract     = {The progradation of the Medjerda delta has been the subject of many studies since the 19th century. The scale and the rapidity of this phenomenon interested researchers in various fields early on, such as geomorphology, geology, palaeogeography, history, archaeology, or geoarchaeology. Indeed, the delta prograded by around 10 km over 3 millennia. At the time of its foundation supposedly at the end of the 12th century BC, the Phoenician city of Utica was located on a promontory bathed by the sea, but the sediments carried by the Medjerda progressively sealed the bay, leaving the tip of the Utica promontory now 10 km inland. This area is therefore an exception to the general pattern along the Tunisian coast, since as over the same period everywhere else there is a regression of the coastline, owing to a sea level rise of several decimeters. Based on multi-proxy analyses of two coring transects, this paper aims to reconstruct the palaeoenvironments and the palaeogeography of the Medjerda delta’s progradation since the mid-Holocene, some aspects of which are described in ancient sources. The results highlight in particular an episode of high-intensity flooding around the 4th century AD, which is consistent with episodes of high floods and an increase in sedimentation rates recorded in the watershed at the end of the Roman period. The gradual abandonment of the city of Utica can certainly be related to the activity of the Medjerda River, but our results show that it is because of an increase of fluvial sediment contribution in connection with an erosive crisis in the headwaters, and not because of the change of course of the river, which had occurred long before.}

	abstract     = {Successful heritage management requires a robust comprehension of the threats facing archaeological sites, at both current and future timescales. Siraf, on the Persian Gulf of Iran, is a site of national and international importance whose history stretches back to the Sassanid period (224–652 AD). In the present context of global change (drought and relative sea-level rise) and anthropogenic impacts (coastal artificialization and reduced sediment supply), the city's waterfront archaeology is undergoing significant erosion. Nonetheless, at present, the processes leading to the loss of Siraf's in situ archaeological remains are still poorly understood, including the rates, timing and drivers of coastal erosion. Here we use Landsat images to monitor shoreline changes along the Siraf coastline between 1973 and 2016. We spatially quantify the causes and impacts of surface changes along 244 transects. The results demonstrate that coastal erosion is responsible for widespread and archaeologically significant damage, with 48% of the studied transects showing erosion during the period 1973–2016. We elucidate significant temporal variations in the data and, most notably, demonstrate that continued drought since the early 2000s has impacted upon sediment supply to coastal areas, severely accentuating erosion. For instance, between 2003 and 2016, 70% of transects recorded shoreline retreat with worrying implications for the waterfront archaeology of Siraf. These quantitative results provide invaluable spatial information regarding the causes and impacts of erosion upon Siraf's waterfront heritage, in addition to furnishing a template for the protection of the city's internationally important cultural heritage.}

It was first surveyed in 1933 by Fritz Frank, who identified Tell el-Kheleifeh with biblical Ezion-geber. Glueck directed three seasons of excavation there between 1938 and 1940. Accepting Frank's identification Glueck discerned five major occupational periods, which he dated between the 10th and 5th centuries B. C. The biblical site provided the historical and cultural context for interpretation of Tell el-Kheleifeh's archaeological data. The results of Glueck's three seasons have not been technically published. This study reappraises his excavations with special attention to the site's stratigraphy, architecture, and pottery traditions. The data suggest that Tell el-Kheleifeh was occupied in two major phases; casemate fortress and fortified settlement. The pottery horizons suggest an occupational history from the 8th to the 6th centuries B. C. with a postscript of uncertain duration. Identification of the site is both an archaeological and an historical problem.}

An uneasy scholarly consensus posits that many fewer than the 200 triremes implied by Thucydides were involved in the momentous defeat, yet the arguments employed by proponents and detractors of this hypothesis have not been decisive. This paper attempts to develop a better understanding of the final stages of the campaign in order to settle the question of losses. Thucydides offers the most reliable narrative of the events in Egypt (1.104, 109-10), but the compressed nature of the pentekontaetia has left us with a brief, lacunary text. Examination of the verbs poliorkein and kataklēiein and the noun poliorkia in appropriate contexts throughout Thucydides' history reveals that the words connote a tight blockade that seeks to deny all supplies to the besieged; the terms do not normally convey less stringent varieties of military harassment. Application of this understanding to the passages in question shows that the 200 triremes initially mentioned by Thucydides could not possibly have been engaged in Egypt when the siege of Prosopitis island began: a force of such size under a tight blockade could never have held out for 18 months. This conclusion is supported by an economic and demographic survey of the fifth-century B.C. Egyptian Delta, which suggests that resources would not have been plentiful in the region. A much smaller Greek force, perhaps 40 to 50 triremes, must have been involved in the final siege.}
