This hypothetical area is close to Diodorus' description:

> the central island might be now connected to the mainland on the NE side where siltation occurred over time, near the outlet of the wadi ; 
> the total area might have been between 2000 and 3000 ha (ample space for his 2000 ships) ;
> the entrance is 300 m wide (more than his 200 feet = 60 m) but this depends much on coral growth which may have varied in time and with urbanisation. Geometry"""@en ;
